                        <strong>Contrary to very popular belief; Bitcoin was NOT designed to make anyone rich.</strong>

                    <p>
                        It's purpose and role is to <strong>free you</strong> from the constraints of a financial system working against you.
                        In 2017, Bitcoin Cash was realized; and with it, the economic tools needed to <strong>save money <em>(on fees);</em></strong> and in turn <strong>grow your own wealth.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Bitcoin Cash Please was <strong>founded at the start of 2020,</strong> just ahead of the 3rd Bitcoin halving.
                        Our primary purpose is on <strong>educating</strong> as many people as possible on <strong>how to use these NEW econonic tools</strong> to build and sustain their own wealth, in the face of an impending global economic recession.
