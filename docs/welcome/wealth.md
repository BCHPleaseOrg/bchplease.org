- the Freedom to __CHOOSE__ what's in your own best interest
- the Freedom to __EXPRESS__ your very best self
- the Freedom to __LOVE__ whomever makes you happy
- the Freedom to __PURSUE__ whatever makes you passionate
- the Freedom to __LEARN__ about what inspires you
- the Freedom to __HELP__ those whom you care about the most
- the Freedom to __INVEST__ your time where it's most valuable
- the Freedom to ...

The Freedom to Wealth may often seem elusive; but I'd like to take a moment to offer you a choice; but in the end, it will be up to __YOU__ to decide what __YOU__ want.
